/// # Why this exists
///
/// `LocalizationCatalogTests` diffs the `en` and `zh-Hans` tables against each
/// other. That catches a key translated in one locale and not the other, but it
/// is blind to the failure that actually happens: a new feature ships a bare
/// `Text("Second row")`, the literal never becomes a key, both tables stay in
/// perfect agreement, and a zh-Hans build renders English. That is exactly how
/// #1252 and #1243 landed — neither PR's diff contained a single `L(` call.
///
/// So this scanner reads the source instead of the catalog: it finds the call
/// sites whose argument AppKit or SwiftUI puts on screen and fails when one of
/// them is handed a literal rather than `L(...)`.
///
/// # Kept out of the app target on purpose
///
/// Nothing here runs in the shipped binary — it reads `.swift` files off disk,
/// which only makes sense from the test bundle. It lives in its own file rather
/// than inside the test so the standalone `swiftc` harness (this host cannot run
/// `swift test`) can exercise the same code the suite does, instead of a
/// reimplementation that could drift from it.
