/// Turns a quota window into the one-line pace caption the Capacity Dock's
/// window columns and the agent-tab quota hover card both draw (#1215): the
/// whole-window average interpretation `QuotaPace` defends (#726 phase 1),
/// rendered as "on pace", a deficit/reserve stage, an estimated exhaustion,
/// or the explicit exhausted state. Deliberately text-only: the math lives in
/// `QuotaPace`, the wording lives here, so both stay testable without a view.
///
/// Honesty rules this type enforces:
/// - The caption describes the AVERAGE pace across the whole elapsed window,
///   never a measured recent rate. The hover/accessibility text says so.
/// - Only validated window durations are used. A window without
///   `windowSeconds` gets no estimate — the label ("Weekly") is not a length.
/// - `Window.percent` is a 0...1 fraction; `QuotaPace` consumes 0...100.
///   This is the one place the unit crosses, and it is tested. Anything
///   outside 0...1 (negative, >1, NaN, infinity) is rejected, not clamped.
/// - A projection is valid only while the sample that produced the window is
///   inside `QuotaSummary`'s ten-minute freshness horizon. A connected
///   account can still carry an old loaded sample while a refresh is pending;
///   that sample must not become a forecast.
/// - The estimate is an ETA measured from `now` ("est. out in 3h 20m"), never
///   a lead before reset, and every countdown is computed against the passed
///   `now`, never a hidden wall clock, so fixtures stay deterministic.
/// - Stale, failed, loading or disconnected quota data gets nothing. A reset
///   in the past, or further out than one full window (clock/data skew), and
///   non-finite reset timestamps are refused before any branch.
