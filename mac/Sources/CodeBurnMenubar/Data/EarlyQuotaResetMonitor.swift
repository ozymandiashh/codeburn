/// Runs `EarlyQuotaResetDetector` over each successful quota fetch, remembers
/// what it has already announced, and posts through the same notifier the
/// update check uses. It adds no polling: the caller invokes it from the
/// existing refresh lifecycle.
///
/// State lives in `UserDefaults`, one JSON record per provider:
/// - the readings from the previous successful fetch only, so a window that
///   was absent last time has no baseline and a baseline is never older than
///   one fetch. The snapshot store keeps each cycle's highest reading instead,
///   which is right for "what did the cycle end at" and wrong for "what did the
///   last fetch say": read as a baseline, it would re-announce a usage-drop
///   reset on every later fetch of the same cycle;
/// - the plan label seen at that fetch;
/// - the scheduled reset time of every announcement already made, matched with
///   the detector's own skew tolerance, so a vendor that briefly serves the old
///   cycle again — possibly from a replica whose timestamp differs by a minute
///   or two — cannot announce the same reset twice, across relaunches included;
/// - the latest event, for the Capacity Dock band;
/// - one reset time per observed cycle, for the 30-day history summary.
///
/// Every key is scoped to one provider by the record it lives in, so an early
/// reset on one provider cannot move another's baseline, dedupe record, band or
/// history. The record's defaults key is unchanged from the one this feature
/// first shipped with, so a Claude event a user has already been notified about
/// is still recognised as announced after the update.
