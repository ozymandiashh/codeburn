//! The settings window and the preferences behind it, the Windows twin of the macOS
//! `Views/SettingsView.swift` scene.
//!
//! Three stores, split by who else needs to read the value:
//!
//! - `~/.config/codeburn/config.json` for anything the CLI also reads (the currency, the
//!   Claude config directories, the daily budget). Written through `config::update`, which
//!   holds the same lock the currency write already took.
//! - `~/.config/codeburn/windows-settings.json` for everything that only this app cares
//!   about (display metric, refresh cadences, terminal, theme, accent). A free-form object
//!   rather than a typed struct, so a new preference costs one line of TypeScript and no
//!   Rust at all.
//! - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\codeburn\provider-keys.dat` for pasted provider API keys, encrypted
//!   with DPAPI so the file is worthless on another machine or under another account.
//!   Off Windows there is no DPAPI and no keyring here, so that same file is a plain-text
//!   fallback: the key is readable by anything running as this user. It is written 0600 in a
//!   0700 directory, which keeps it away from the other accounts on the box and does nothing
//!   more than that. See `seal`.
//!
//! Every write emits `codeburn://settings-changed` with the whole settings object, because
//! the popover, the tray and the Capacity Dock all render from it and none of them polls.

//
// windows-settings.json and windows-dock.json are each owned by two processes at once: this
// tray app and the Electron desktop app. Both do a read / modify / write to merge their own
// keys into whatever the other last stored. The atomic rename each already does stops a torn
// file, but not a lost update: two writers read the same state, change different keys, and the
// later rename erases the earlier writer's key. The user watches a dock placement, an enabled
// switch, a provider choice or a scale silently revert. This lock serializes the whole cycle
// so that never happens. It is the one place the protocol is written down; `dock.rs` and
// `app/electron/tray-settings.ts` point here rather than restating it.
//
// PROTOCOL (honoured identically by app/electron/tray-settings.ts):
//
//   Lock file:  sibling of the target named `.<stem>.lock` (windows-dock.json ->
//               `.windows-dock.lock`), the same `.config.lock` shape config.rs uses.
//   Body:       one line of JSON, `{"pid":<os pid>,"at":<unix ms>}`.
//   Acquire:    exclusive create (create_new / 'wx'). On success the holder keeps the handle
//               open for the whole cycle and returns a guard. On collision the existing lock
//               is taken over only if abandoned; otherwise the contender polls until a short
//               wait budget runs out and then FAILS loudly rather than writing behind the
//               holder, so a contended write is reported to the caller, never silently lost.
//   Abandoned:  its mtime is older than the stale window (a crashed holder never refreshes
//               it), OR its recorded pid is not our own and no longer alive. The pid probe is
//               the fast path for a crash: a dead holder is recovered on the first poll, well
//               inside the wait budget. The age gate is the backstop for a pid we cannot probe
//               or a reused one. A live holder is neither, which is the safety argument: a
//               fresh mtime plus a live pid are never taken, and the read/modify/write it
//               guards finishes in milliseconds, orders of magnitude inside the stale window.
//   Takeover:   removing an abandoned lock is itself arbitrated, by an exclusive create of
//               `<lock>.takeover`. Only its winner may unlink the lock, and only after
//               re-checking that the lock is still abandoned, so two contenders racing the
//               same stale lock cannot both end up holding it. See `reclaim`.
//   Release:    close the handle and unlink the lock, unless it now carries a different pid
//               (a successor's), which is left alone.
//
// Reads take no lock: every writer renames a whole file into place, so a reader sees the old
// file or the new one, never a torn one (the same reason config::read is lock-free). That is
// still the right trade, but it is not free on Windows: a rename over a file some other process
// has open can fail outright there rather than wait, so a read on either side can make a write
// on the other fail. `replace_file` is where that is absorbed.
//
// Lessons borrowed from src/cache-refresh-lock.ts: exclusive create as the arbiter, a pid +
// timestamp record, a staleness window so a dead holder cannot wedge the file forever, and a
// bounded wait that never blocks indefinitely.
